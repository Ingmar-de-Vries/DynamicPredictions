Example anonymous dataset with which code should work. Please notify me if any problems arise. A few notes about this dataset: 

  - This is a real dataset used in the study. Note that for privacy reasons, the individual anatomical scan is not included at this stage. This dataset only serves as a demo dataset. However, both the preprocessed data at sensor level and the inversion kernel to transform sensor level data to source level data are included. The inversion kernel is computed using the individual anatomical scan for this particular dataset. Files included:
